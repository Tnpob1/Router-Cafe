        <p class="text-2xl">
          Along with Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Intelligentsia and Revelator, La Colombe is a coffee
          company that might be coming soon to a corner near you. The Philly-based coffee roaster is
          helmed by one of the world's boldest coffee hunters (check out his Travel Channel show,
          Dangerous Grounds), who has led the company to pursue a perfect cup through innovations
          like proprietary brew methods and boundary-pushing drinks like a canned latte (one that's
          actually good!). La Colombe’s flagship Fishtown location offers the usual full
          espresso-drink menu, a manual brew bar and the world's first-ever draft latte. Add an
          in-house bakery, a wood-fired pizza oven, a tasting room and even a rum distillery, and
          you’ve got a recipe for one of the very best coffee shops in the country.
