        <p class="text-2xl">
          To celebrate its three-year anniversary, Artifact gave away free coffee for three days.
          While that idea might make the average coffee shop owner's head explode, Artifact isn't
          the average coffee shop. The brew-and-breakfast arm of the Woodberry Kitchen empire,
          Artifact serves Counter Culture's finest single-origin beans as pour-over, shareable
          Chemex or Japanese iced coffee, but also offers homemade soda and sangria. The kitchen
          cooks regional specialties like scrapple and a deluxe menu of soups, salads and
          sandwiches, which all makes a winning equation for a successful daytime operation. Once
          night falls and the coffee sales decrease, the community engagement just grows, thanks to
          the Artifact After Dark series, which offers customers a chance to connect with local
          chefs and artists.
