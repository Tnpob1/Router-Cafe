        <p class="text-2xl">
          Nitro cold brew is all the rage, but few people know that the trend began in Austin. Cuvée
          has been instrumental in jump-starting the city's specialty coffee culture, from supplying
          countless shops with wholesale beans to cracking the nitro cold brew market with its
          canned Black and Blue. After nearly a decade in the business, the owners finally opened a
          shop on East 6th Street that features several of their yearly roasts, as well as a
          featured coffee like their Hartebeest from southern Ethiopia. A solid list of local beers
          on tap rounds out the offerings, but one thing you won't find at this shop is Wi-Fi: It’s
          been disabled to help bolster conversation and a sense of community that's seldom seen in
          other shops around town.
