        <p class="text-2xl">
          Although many of the nation's best coffee shops have eschewed traditional beatnik
          atmospheres in favor of sleeker, more austere designs, those in North Carolina's Research
          Triangle maintain the collegiate attitude that as long as the couches are comfy, there's
          no need for them to match. Cocoa Cinnamon in Durham is a great example, making it a magnet
          for Duke students who're drawn to the laid-back environment and energizing coffees, which
          feature unique flavor additions like rose water and black pepper.
