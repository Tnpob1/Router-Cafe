        <p class="text-2xl">
          New Orleans is all about tradition, so although you can get an amazing shot at Cherry
          Espresso Bar, the best in show is the classic at Cafe du Monde. The atmosphere at the
          French Market location is pure NOLA; for 150 years there have been 24-hour lines of locals
          and tourists looking for their chicory coffee-and-beignet fix. And if your sweet tooth
          isn't satisfied by a mere pastry, walk your powdered sugar-coated figure next door to the
          neighboring Evan's Creole Candy Factory, which Caf√© du Monde recently acquired.
