        <p class="text-2xl">
          Panther Coffee in Miamiâ€™s hip Wynwood neighborhood is only a quick 90-minute flight from
          Guatemala City. The easy access to Latin America makes developing direct-trade
          relationships with farms easier, and also means a diverse clientele of international
          coffee lovers, some who hail from the very same towns that grow Panther's coffees. Inside
          the shop, along with the hum of a vintage pre-World War II Probat coffee roaster, you can
          hear so many languages that it's easy to forget you're only a few minutes from Miami
          Beach. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Hernandez
